# famine

Famine is a binary that will modify one or multiple binaries applying some additional functions to it/them, without modifying the original behavior of said binary(ies). It will add a “signature” to this binary and nothing else. Famine will apply this “signature” to all the binaries present in a specific temporary folder. The “signature” is symbolized with a line containing my login which look like that:

`Famine version 1.0 (c)oded by clanier`

Each infected binaries will become a virus too.
